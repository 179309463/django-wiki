# django-wiki and bootstrap

Everything in this directory is a copy of Bootstrap, except the `wiki/` directory
where modifications to the original Bootstrap rules live.

If you want your own Bootstrap, it is recommended to copy in the styles
from wiki-boostrap or to symlink the files to your own Bootstrap LESS tree
and compile again.
