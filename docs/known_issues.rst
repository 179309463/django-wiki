Known Issues
============

Django 1.4
----------

In the requirements is stated ``sorl-thumbnail>11.12.1b`` which is the newest beta of sorl-thumbnail. However, you need to downgrade after.

Django 1.7 and Python 2.6
-------------------------

Those are incompatible with each other and can never be combined as Dj 1.7 dropped Py 2.6 support.
